# Analysis of Seattle Airbnb dataset in Kaggle

## Installation
This project utilizes default packages within the Anaconda distribution of Python for the majority of the analysis.

## Project Motivation
By analyzing Seattle Airbnb data, we are interested in the three questions:
1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
2. How are Seattle Airbnb listings varying between neighborhoods?
3. What are the main factors that affect the price of an airbnb?

## File Descriptions
All analysis was implemented in Jupyter Notebook Seattle_airbnb.ipynb.
